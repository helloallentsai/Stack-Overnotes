## Hello! ##
Click a deck and begin studying right away. Or load your own deck with a .csv file. You can add a new card to any deck. Each card can also be edited and deleted. This app will cycle through a deck providing a random flashcard.

Need to peek at the definition? Click the body of the card or hit the down arrow.

Once you know a flashcard well enough, click done to remove it from the shuffle, or hit Enter.

If you want to move onto a random card click next, or hit Spacebar.

Simply click restart to study the deck again, or hit R.

If you need more info on the word, click on the StackOverflow icon  and you'll be provided a few links.

## Study hard. Study often. Study well. ##
